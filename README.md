# Student Clashboard - Yoobee Project
We were tasked with creating a data visualisation dashboard, one that effectively showcased the demographic of the Yoobee
Web and UX class. 

This data visualisation is interactive and simple to use but it is a non responsive interface, so it is limited to the use
of a standard PC sized screen.
